Task-03: Decision Tree Classifier for Customer Purchase Prediction
In this task, we develop a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral attributes. We use datasets such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which contains features like age, job type, marital status, education, previous campaign outcomes, and more.

Steps included:

Loading and preprocessing the dataset (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, etc.).

Splitting the data into training and testing sets.

Building a Decision Tree model using libraries such as scikit-learn.

Training the model and evaluating its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

Visualizing the tree structure to understand decision paths and feature importance.

This task demonstrates how machine learning models can be applied in marketing and customer analytics to drive data-informed decisions.
